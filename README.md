# ChatBot.
Key Features:
 Casual Conversations: The chatbot can engage in
general chit-chat, providing responses based on pre-
trained data. I used Chatterbot to train the bot on various
conversational patterns and responses.
 Mathematical Queries: Users can ask the chatbot
mathematical questions, and it will perform calculations
and provide accurate answers. This feature leverages
Numpy for handling complex mathematical operations.

Implementation:
 Training the Chatbot: For casual conversations, I used
Chatterbot’s training functionality to input a range of
conversational data, which helped the chatbot learn
different response patterns. I also employed Spacy for
advanced NLP tasks, such as entity recognition and
intent classification, to improve the chatbot's
understanding of user inputs.

 Mathematical Queries: To handle mathematical
queries, I integrated Numpy to process and compute
mathematical expressions. This allows the chatbot to
solve equations and perform arithmetic operations
effectively.

 Web Interface: I developed a Flask-based web interface
that allows users to interact with the chatbot through a
simple and intuitive web page. This interface includes
input fields for users to type their questions and a display
area for the chatbot's responses.
